             history:"Daffodils were introduced into gardens in about 300BC. The Greek botanist and philosopher Theophrastus listed and described many of the earliest known kinds of narcissus in his nine-volume 'Enquiry into Plants'. Daffodils were brought to Britain by the Romans who thought that the sap from daffodils had healing powers.A flowering bulb well known to many gardeners, is the miniature daffodil Narcissus Tete-a-Tete. This lovely unassuming flower of late winter and early spring is a welcome sight soon after winter's cold has passed. It is an intriguing plant in many regards, not the least of which is its somewhat uncertain origin."

              history:"The Wild Rose Flower or Species Rose is a single rose which evolved about 70 million years ago  (the far distant ancestor of the single rose of today - and all the others) and it was flourishing before the Dinosaurs perished.The allure of roses is a universal one — and certainly not restricted to gardeners alone! This queen of flowers has played a major role in poetry, religion, art, and literature; music, medicine, fashion design, perfume, and home decoration — even in cuisine. It is an ancient flower, grown for thousands of years throughout Asia and the Orient before it ever made an appearance in the Western world.Images of wild roses were even found in the Pyramids of ancient Egypt.The most popular roses found in the class of Modern Roses are the Hybrid Tea Roses, Floribunda Roses, and Grandiflora Roses."

              history:"Sunflower was a common crop among American Indian tribes throughout North America. Evidence suggests that the plant was cultivated by American Indians in present-day Arizona and New Mexico about 3000 BC. Some archaeologists suggest that sunflower may have been domesticated before corn.Sunflowers also symbolize worship and faithfulness in various religions because of their resemblance to the sun, which is associated with spiritual knowledge and the desire to seek light and truth. The Incas used sunflowers to symbolize the Sun God, and brought them to temples for worship. Sunflowers are the symbol of faith, loyalty and adoration. They follow the movement of the sun across the sky from east to west, and this process is known as heliotropism."
